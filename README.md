# Online-Blood-Donation-Management-System
The purpose of this project is to develop a blood donation management information system to assist in the management of blood donor records and ease or control the distribution
of blood in various parts of the country based on demands from hospital. Without quick and timely access to donor records, creating market strategies for blood donation, 
lobbying and sensitization of blood donors becomes very difficult. The Blood Donation Management Information System offers functionalities like quick access to donorâ€™s records
collected from various parts of the country. It enables monitoring of the results and performance of the blood donation activity such that relevant and measurable objectives 
of the organization can be checked. This provides the management timely, confidential and secure medical reports that facilitates planning and decision making and therefore
improved medical service delivery. The blood donation service involves a series of interdependent operations such as donor registration, donor screening or evaluation, 
blood collection, blood screening, inventory management, and blood dissemination.
